The [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) function can be used directly in JSX which is concise and declarative in comparison to any for loop or variation thereof. Below, we are looping through the array of users and return all of the user list item elements.

```jsx
function App() {
  const users = ['John', 'Dan', 'Jenny'];

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => {
        return <li>{user}</li>;
      })}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Our code has one issue currently. We need to [key](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) our items so that React can tell when items have changed in some way. Our data doesn't have a unique ID field so the easiest solution is to use the [uuid](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) package to generate them client side.

```bash
yarn add uuid
```

```jsx
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

function App() {
  const users = ['John', 'Dan', 'Jenny'];

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => {
        return <li key={uuidv4()}>{user}</li>;
      })}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

The other option is to change the shape of your source data:
```jsx
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

function App() {
  const users = [
    { id: 1, name: 'John' },
    { id: 2, name:  'Dan' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Jenny' }
  ];

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => {
        return <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>;
      })}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
