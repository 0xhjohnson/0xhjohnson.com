### Issue
Ran into an issue the other day where deleting a Gatsby post did not remove it from my blog. Upon inspection, I noticed that the .cache folder had a reference to the deleted post.

### Fix
Just need to delete the .cache folder. For more insight have a look at this [Github issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/2410). Gatsby will recreate it on the next `gatsby build` or `gatsby develop` command.

From your project folder run:

```bash
rm -r ./.cache/*
```
